  abstract = {An approach to numerical convection is presented that exclusively yields upstream-centered schemes. It starts from a meshwise approximation of the initial-value distribution by simple basic functions, e.g., Legendre polynomials. In every mesh the integral of the distribution is conserved. The overall approximation need not be continuous. The approximate distribution is convected explicitly and then remapped meshwise in terms of the basic functions. The weights of the basic functions that approximate the initial values in a mesh may be determined by finite differencing, but the most accurate schemes are obtained by least-squares fitting. In the latter schemes, the weights of the basic functions must be regarded as independent state quantities and must be stored separately. Examples of second-order and third-order schemes are given, and the accuracy of these schemes is discussed. Several monotonicity algorithms, designed to prevent numerical oscillations, are indicated. Numerical examples are given of linear and nonlinear wave propagation, also regarding monotonicity.}

  abstract = {Benchmark solutions to nontrivial radiation transport problems are crucial to the validation of transport codes. This paper gives an analytical transport solution for non-equilibrium radiative transfer in an infinite and isotropically scattering medium. The radiation source in the medium is isotropic in angle and constant in time (but only exists in a finite period of time), and is allowed to be uniformly distributed in a finite space or to be located at a point. The solution is constructed by applying the Fourier transform with respect to spatial variable and the Laplace transform with respect to temporal variable. The integration over angular variable is treated exactly. The resulting solution, as a function of space and time and in the form of a double integral, is evaluated numerically without much difficulty. Tables and figures are given for the resulting benchmark solution.}
